# GBR Burn Token Contract

This contract was created to burn GBR token. In its essence, it is a repository of "burned" tokens, which will no longer be used and will be stored in it forever.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
